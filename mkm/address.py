class NetworkID(IntEnum):
    """
        @enum MKMNetworkID

        @abstract A network type to indicate what kind the entity is.

        @discussion An address can identify a person, a group of people,
            a team, even a thing.

            MKMNetwork_Main indicates this entity is a person's account.
            An account should have a public key, which proved by meta data.

            MKMNetwork_Group indicates this entity is a group of people,
            which should have a founder (also the owner), and some members.

            MKMNetwork_Moments indicates a special personal social network,
            where the owner can share information and interact with its friends.
            The owner is the king here, it can do anything and no one can stop it.

            MKMNetwork_Polylogue indicates a virtual (temporary) social network.
            It's created to talk with multi-people (but not too much, e.g. < 100).
            Any member can invite people in, but only the founder can expel member.

            MKMNetwork_Chatroom indicates a massive (persistent) social network.
            It's usually more than 100 people in it, so we need administrators
            to help the owner to manage the group.

            MKMNetwork_SocialEntity indicates this entity is a social entity.

            MKMNetwork_Organization indicates an independent organization.

            MKMNetwork_Company indicates this entity is a company.

            MKMNetwork_School indicates this entity is a school.

            MKMNetwork_Government indicates this entity is a government department.

            MKMNetwork_Department indicates this entity is a department.

            MKMNetwork_Thing this is reserved for IoT (Internet of Things).

        Bits:
            0000 0001 - this entity's branch is independent (clear division).
            0000 0010 - this entity can contains other group (big organization).
            0000 0100 - this entity is top organization.
            0000 1000 - (Main) this entity acts like a human.

            0001 0000 - this entity contains members (Group)
            0010 0000 - this entity needs other administrators (big organization)
            0100 0000 - this is an entity in reality.
            1000 0000 - (IoT) this entity is a 'Thing'.

            (All above are just some advices to help choosing numbers :P)
